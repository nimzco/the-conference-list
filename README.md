## Adding a conference

Conferences are JSON based files. They have the following structure:

```json
  {
    "name": "",
    "url": "",
    "startDate": "2018-08-17",
    "endDate": "2018-08-19",
    "city": "",
    "country": "",
    "cfpUrl": "",
    "cfpEndDate": "",
    "twitter": ""
  }
```

Dates are formatted like `YYYY-MM-DD`, and if the date has not been defined yet, you can use this format as well: `YYYY-MM`.

- To add JavaScript conferences, create a Pull Request on the [javascript-conferences repo](https://github.com/tech-conferences/javascript-conferences).
- For all other conferences, create a Pull Request on this repo.
